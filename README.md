# Syllabus
Courses on multigrid methods: beginning with the fundamentals of
classic multigrid algorithms and analysis (70's & 80's); continuing
with algebraic multigrid (90's & 2000's); and culminating with
contemporary multigrid research in fast solvers for adaptive mesh
refinement discretizations of elliptic and hyperbolic real world
problems deployed in he Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing (PETSc).
