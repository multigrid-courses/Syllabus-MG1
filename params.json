Some analysis is presented but advanced multigrid\r\ntheory, which is thoroughly covered by\r\n[Hackbusch (1985)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Multi_grid_methods_and_applications.html?id=Vf8_AQAAIAAJ),\r\nis not presented. A basic knowledge of analysis, partial differential equations, and\r\nnumerical methods is assumed, as well as some experience with\r\nprogramming. We use Matlab from programming assignments and\r\nGit, hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com), for code and document management.\r\nThis coarse introduces some ideas in modern software engineering such\r\nas distributed repositories and collaboration.\r\n\r\n##  Overview of Multigrid Course Series \r\n\r\n1. **MG1**: Introduction to multigrid methods with applications to elliptic and\r\n   hyperbolic problems (this course)\r\n1. **MG2**: Algebraic Multigrid with application to elasticity\r\n1. **MG3**: Contemporary Multigrid: hybrid structured/unstructured adaptive mesh refinement, hyperbolic\r\n  problems with geometric multigrid, on emerging architectures,\r\n  advance scientific software engineering in the Portable Extensible\r\n  Toolkit for Scientific Computing (PETSc) with applications to\r\n  magnetohydrodynamics and computational fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites for MG1\r\n\r\n* A numerical analysis course (MSE XXX or equivalent)\r\n* A laptop in class for exercises, etc.\r\n\r\nThese won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost\r\nwithout some numerical analysis background, and not having a laptop\r\nwill encumber some hands-on class work.\r\n\r\n* Some familiarity with\r\n  [Git and GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github) is\r\n  suggested.\r\n* Students should create a personal account on\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/join) before the first class\r\n\r\n## Course Overview\r\n\r\nWe will cover basic iterative methods, Local Fourier Analysis (LFA),\r\nand two grid analysis. We go over basic smoother methods and intergrid\r\ntransfer operators and analysis their potential efficacy on model\r\nelliptic and hyperbolic problems. We will consider operator dependent\r\nintergrid transfer operators and applications to problems in\r\ncomputational fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nStudents will develop a multigrid solver in Matlab for programming\r\nprojects and Git, hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com), for code and\r\ndocument management.\r\n\r\nThe course will be co-instructed, via advanced teleconferencing\r\nfacilities, with courses at Rice University and KAUST.\r\n\r\n## Course Material\r\n\r\n* [*An Introduction to Multigrid Methods*](http://docs.mak.ac.ug/sites/default/files/An%20Introduction%20to%20Multigrid%20Methods,%20by%20Pieter%20Wesseling.pdf)\r\nby Wesseling, is used as the main text\r\n\t- May ignore discussion on meshing, parallel programing,\r\n      \"structure diagrams\", and skip ILU and complexity analysis\r\n* [*Multigrid*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-og1wD-Nx_wC)\r\nTrottenberg, Oosterlee, and Schüller, is an excellent book and is\r\nrecommended as a reference\r\n\t- My multigrid bible\r\n* [*A Multigrid Tutorial*](https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Multigrid_Tutorial.html?id=oSTGBm64o1AC)  by Briggs, Henson, and McCormick, is a good general multigrid tutorial\r\n\t- Go U.S.A.\r\n\r\n### Workflow\r\n\r\nAll code and documents will be managed using Git and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).\r\nHere are the overall steps to turning in a homework assignment:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repository for the exercise or project (found under [github.com/multigrid-courses](https://github.com/multigrid-courses)).\r\n1. Clone the repository to your computer:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:multigrid-courses/MG1-HW1\r\n```\r\n1. Modify the files to complete your solution.\r\n1. Make sure all of your code is committed:\r\n```\r\ngit commit -am\"all done\"\r\n```\r\n1. Push to GitHub to a branch user/assignment:\r\n```\r\ngit push -u origin name/hw1\r\n```\r\n1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. All assignments are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.\r\n1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let us know it's been updated.\r\n\r\nFeedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@adams` with the question to make sure I know to look at it sooner.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](http://documentup.com/advanced-js/syllabus#statements-on-plagiarism/instructor).\r\n* Bonus points for Creativity (as long as requirements are fulfilled)\r\n\r\n## Course Outline\r\n\r\n### Class 1\r\n\r\n1.
